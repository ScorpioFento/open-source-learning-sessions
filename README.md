<h2>👋 Welcome</h2>

Hey there, welcome to <b>Open-Source Learning Sessions</b> — a project I started with one clear goal:  
👉 <b>make the first steps into web development easier for juniors and beginners.</b>  

When I first started, I struggled with scattered tutorials and confusing resources.  
That’s why this repo is built as a <b>step-by-step journey</b>: starting from the <b>absolute basics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)</b> and moving into <b>React.js fundamentals</b>.  

---

<h2>📚 What’s Inside?</h2>

Each section contains a <b>lesson</b> (explained in simple words) + <b>examples</b> you can run right away:  

<ul>
  <li>📄 <b>HTML Basics</b> → structure, forms, images, tables</li>
  <li>🎨 <b>CSS Basics</b> → selectors, flexbox, grid, responsive layouts</li>
  <li>⚡ <b>JavaScript Basics</b> → variables, loops, DOM, events</li>
  <li>⚛️ <b>React.js</b> → components, props, state, event handling</li>
</ul>

<h2>💡 Why I Built This</h2>

<blockquote><b>Teaching others = learning better yourself ✨</b></blockquote>

As a mid-level developer, this project is both:  
- 📝 a way for me to <b>solidify my own knowledge</b>  
- 🤝 a way to <b>give back to juniors</b> who are just starting out  

This repo isn’t just code — it’s meant to be a <b>community-driven learning path</b>.
