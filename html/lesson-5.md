# Lesson 5 â€” HTML `<div>` Tag & Sectioning  

**Path 1: HTML**  

The `<div>` tag is one of the most commonly used HTML elements. It serves as a **generic container** for grouping content and applying styles or scripts. While `<div>` itself has no semantic meaning, it is essential for layout and organization.

## ðŸ§© Overview  

- `<div>` is used to **group related elements** together.  
- It is often combined with **CSS classes or IDs** to apply styling or manipulate content with JavaScript.  
- While `<div>` is generic, semantic elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` should be used when meaning is important.
